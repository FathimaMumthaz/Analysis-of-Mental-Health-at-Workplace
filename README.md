# Analysis-of-Mental-Health-at-Workplace

Your emotional, psychological, and social well-being are all impacted by your mental health. It influences our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Additionally, it influences how we respond to stress, interact with others, and make decisions. In the workplace, effective high-performing teams or people must have strong communication and inclusiveness abilities. An organization's response to mental health issues may result in more missed workdays, lower productivity, and lower employee engagement. Approximately 70% of individuals with depression work in the United States. An estimated 35 million workdays would be lost by employees with depression each year as a result of mental illness. Untreated depression among employees is thought to cause a 35% decline in productivity, costing companies $105 billion annually.

By giving individuals the skills they need to start a conversation so that more people can seek the care they need, including mental health awareness in the workplace may help pave the way for mental health concerns across your community.
